An embedded sofware engineer that has way too many incomplete hobby projects.

Tinkering with ideas or figuring out how something is done by doing it myself is what I do in my repos. The problem with that is as soon as the puzzle is solved the fun is over and it becomes work.
Some day I will have a public repo that actually contributes something. When that day comes let me know, I'll update this message.
